ScopeOut
========

An open-source software package for controlling &amp; reading out VISA USB oscilloscopes.
Extends pyVisa to make scope setup and scripting easy with a library of useful commands.

Also includes an PyQt-based GUI that allows simple waveform acquisition, analysis, and compilation, turning any oscilloscope from a diagnostic instrument into a legitimate data-acquisition tool.

Requires the NI-VISA library, pyVisa, and a number of packages enumerated in `requirements.txt`. However, it is highly recommended that the ScopeOut source files be run on the Anaconda Python distribution, which integrates nearly all the requirements seamlessly.
